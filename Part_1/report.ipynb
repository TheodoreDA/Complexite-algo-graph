    "1) Here is a list of 10 houses: [-5, -2, -1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sorting the houses positions:    5+8+9+15+16+17+18+19+20+21 = 148 / 10 = 14.8\n",
    "\n",
    "    Going to the closest house:      1+2+5+15+16+17+18+19+20+21 = 134 / 10 = 13.4\n",
    "\n",
    "    Optimal solution (going right first, as there is a cluster on the right):\n",
    "                                     5+6+7+8+9+10+11+23+24+27   = 130 / 10 = 13\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of this solution is that there is a cluster on one side, and by begining with the cluster instead of going to the closest first and make the cluster wait, you reduce the average waiting time of all the houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) My algorithm can be found in the file `algo`, under the function named `parcours()`. It reduced to the following: as the houses are generated with a normal distribution centered in 0, I will split the houses in four sections (extreme left, core left, core right and extreme right). We need to find a threshold to separate the cores from the extremes, and by empirical tries, I found that 40% of the maximum absolute value works fine (for at least 1000 houses). This algorithm could be improved by tweaking this threshold.\n",
    "   Next, we want to tackle the most concentrated cluster first, so taking the left or right core section is ideal. As the generation is random and with a great enough number of houses, I don't need to bother deciding left or right. Arbitrarely, I go left first, then extreme left, then the right core, then the extreme right. In order to distribute the value into the four sections, I need to sort the houses first, then appening the value to the four lists is easier and faster (as I will need to append N value to the lists, sorting then using .append() is faster than not sorting and using the .insert() function).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's are the results I find with my algorithm, and my implementations of sorting left_to_right, right_to_left, and going to the closest house (partially found online here https://stackoverflow.com/a/12141207/14086720):"
